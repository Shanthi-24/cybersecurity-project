hiding a text inside the image steganography encoding and decoding
Image Steganography is the main content of information hiding. The sender conceal a secret message into a cover image, then get the container image called stego, and finish the secret messageâ€™s transmission on the public channel by transferring the stego image. Then the receiver part of the transmission can reveal the secret message out. Steganalysis is an attack to the steganography algorithm. The listener on the public channel intercept the image and analyze whether the image contains secret information.
Image Steganography Using Python 
Steganography project with gui. Hides text inside image. Least Significant Algorithm (LSB) is used to hide the text.
